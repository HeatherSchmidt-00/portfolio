      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article>
      <h3>For the love of the outdoors...</h3>
      <p>As a lover of outdoor adventure, I was inspired to create an <em>Outdoor Adventure Clubhouse</em>.
         I founded this clubhouse, <strong>Landsmith</strong>, in the fall of 2018, but the spark of Landsmith really started on my first solo bikepacking trip
         down the coast of California back in 2015. I remember the excitement, the nervousness, the doubt in myself.

        <h4>What I learned:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I can not only ride my bike, but fix it too!</li>
            <li>Sleeping outside under the redwoods is magical</li>
            <li>People are truly kind</li>
            <li>Eucalyptus trees are my most favorite scent</li>
            <li>Traveling + adventuring by the power of my own body is awesome</li>
            <li>There is no such thing as eating "too many donuts"</li>
          </ul>

    <p>
       This perspective-changing trip gifted me a new approach to life â€“ one that centers around taking time
       to be outside, connecting with nature, honoring the outdoors, and creating meaningful connections.
       This approach to life lives in connecting with the outdoors and each other, and it influences every
       aspect of my work.
