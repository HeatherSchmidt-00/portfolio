			  	<p class="italics">The grizzly bear, also known as the North American brown bear or simply grizzly,
				is a large population or subspecies of the brown bear inhabiting North America.

				<li>Scientific Name: Ursus arctos horribilis</li>

				<li>Average Weight (Male): 400-790 lb</li>

				Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first described it as grisley,
				which could be interpreted as either "grizzly"
				(i.e., "grizzled"â€”that is, with golden and grey tips of the hair)
				or "grisly" ("fear-inspiring", now usually "gruesome").
				The modern spelling supposes the former meaning; even so,
				naturalist George Ord formally classified it in 1815 as U. horribilis,
				not for its hair, but for its character.
